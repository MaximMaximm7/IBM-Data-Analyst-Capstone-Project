# IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Capstone-Project

Business challenge that requires data analysis was performed on real-world datasets.  

Various tasks were performed, including: 
- Data collection from multiple sources 
- Data wrangling and data preparation 
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Statistical analysis and data mining 
- Data visualization with different charts and plots
- Interactive dashboard creation

The project culminated with a presentation of data analysis report for various stakeholders in the organization. 
The report included an executive summary, analysis, and a conclusion. 

Throughout this project, I demonstrated proficiency in using Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, Relational Databases (RDBMS), Business Intelligence (BI) tools such as Cognos, and Python libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others.
